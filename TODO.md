## Just a short list of TODO's

### Backlog

* [ ] Add shout outs for the people involved in testing (waiting for TheExpertNoob)

### For next release

* [ ] Make sure the Makefile is compatible to "older" systems, do not use fancy options that are not supported through all versions of wget and similar

### Maybe later

* [ ] rename hostname to something cool
* [ ] swap the alarm user with something related to PirateBox
* [ ] Add information about raspiconfig and disk resize to MOTD

### Done
Just for reference until they have been noted in a Changelog.
