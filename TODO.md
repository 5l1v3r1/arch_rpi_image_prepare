## Just a short list of TODO's

### For current release

* [ ] Add shout outs for the people involved in testing (waiting for TheExpertNoob)
* [x] Do not copy hostapd config files, instead parse the available one
  * [x] Delete directories with config files
* [ ] Move scripts to the piratebox ws repository where it makes sense
  * [ ] move all scripts from helpers
  * [ ] adapt piratebox install script

### Maybe later

* [ ] rename hostname to something cool
* [ ] swap the alarm user with something related to PirateBox
* [ ] Add information about raspiconfig and disk resize to MOTD

### Done
Just for reference until they have been noted in a Changelog.
